Special thanks to the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge for providing me with help for this project.
I went through the tutorial and created the project, but then created a second without the tutorial,
taking subtle references from the first-time-around if I needed help. It has really helped ingrain 
CSS3/JavaScript into my mind. 



This project is based heavily on using the 'Date()' method in JavaScript, and applying some CSS to create
a shnazy-looking clock! This project was very CSS3 heavy. I am happy I completed the project and worked through it
slowly again, but I was able to look at all of the CSS3 in detail. Sometimes there's just too much time on my hands.
